                <p>We went there for our team outing after a long day of work. It was my first time trying the pottery class. I knew it would be fun, but I didn't expect it to be this fun! I guess a huge part of it was because the teacher did a great job in guiding us to appreciate the beauty and fun of making potteries!</p>

                <p>Took a 2 hour wheel throwing class here and had so much fun!  This was my first time trying it, and the instructor did a great job of explaining the techniques and very patiently walked me through the parts I had trouble with.  Would definitely come back for more lessons in the future!</p>

                <p>I've taken several classes here. It's a fantastic space with wonderful artists of all levels. Not being particularly artistic myself, I've learned a lot and met some wonderful people. Always something new to aspire to. Glaze Studio is an open space to share ideas, learn something new and meet great people! Highly recommended!</p>
